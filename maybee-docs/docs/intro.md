# Introduction

## Overview

MayBee revolutionizes prediction markets by combining blockchain technology with the accessibility of Telegram. Our platform enables users to participate in binary (Yes/No) betting markets with complete transparency and trustless settlement through UMA Oracle integration.

## Project Description

MayBee is designed to make prediction markets accessible to everyone through a Telegram Mini App. Users can easily place wagers on trending topics directly through our Telegram bot @maybee01_bot or via the MayBee App. The platform leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparency and fairness, while maintaining the user-friendly experience of a Telegram interface.

To keep users informed and engaged, we've created dedicated channels that highlight the most active markets over the last hour and 24 hours. This feature ensures users never miss out on trending opportunities and can quickly participate in the most engaging predictions.

## Platform Architecture

### Telegram Integration

The heart of MayBee's accessibility lies in its seamless Telegram integration. Users can interact with the platform through our dedicated bot @maybee01_bot, which provides real-time updates and an intuitive betting interface. Our dedicated channels ensure users stay informed about the hottest markets, creating a dynamic and engaging community.

### Smart Contract Infrastructure

Our smart contract forms the backbone of MayBee's trustless betting system. Built with security and transparency in mind, it manages market creation, bet placement, and automated settlement through UMA Oracle. The contract implements a robust role-based access control system and ensures fair distribution of winnings.

### Technical Implementation

MayBee combines modern web technologies with blockchain capabilities:

- A responsive frontend built with Next.js and TypeScript
